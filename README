(10+2)5 OS X Dashboard Widget

A ridiculously simple widget to pace (10+2)*5 work sessions. Tells you when
to "Start" and "Stop" working, and announces the passing hours (always 5
iterations, whether or not you've finished tasks early). 

Punch the button once to start working. If you finish a task early, punch the
button to skip to break. To stop the clock completely, punch the button
during break (i.e., twice if it thinks youâ€™re working).

Uses OS X's speech synthesizer to make inconspicuous announcements, so check
your volume!
